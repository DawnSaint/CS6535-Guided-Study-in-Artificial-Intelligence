While the cupcakes and desserts were indeed delicious and beautifully presented, the service was unreliable, which is a big deal for me. The owner, Chelle, was responsive at first but then became uncommunicative, especially when issues arose. This inconsistency and lack of professionalism, particularly for important events, is a significant drawback. I appreciate the free delivery and the reasonable prices, but the reliability issues and unprofessional behavior make it hard to recommend this bakery without reservation."

The outdoor seating area is a nice touch, making it a great spot for a casual dinner. However, the service was a bit hit or miss. While some servers were attentive and friendly, others were slow and understaffed, which affected the overall dining experience. The food was fresh and the portions were reasonable, but the prices were a bit steep for what was offered. Overall, it's a decent place to try, but there's room for improvement in service and value."

The variety of delicious frozen yogurt flavors, especially the tart and pomegranate raspberry sorbet, is impressive, and the extensive topping selection, including fresh fruits and unique options like butterscotch chips, is a real plus. However, the service can be hit or miss, with some staff being friendly and helpful while others are less attentive. The pricing model, which charges by weight, can be steep, especially if you overfill your cup. Despite these drawbacks, the overall experience is still enjoyable, but there's room for improvement in consistency and value."

However, the business has some issues with inconsistency and reliability, which can be frustrating. Additionally, the prices are on the higher side, especially for basic services. While I appreciate the local and longstanding presence of the business, these drawbacks make it a bit of a mixed bag. Overall, it's a good option, but there's room for improvement in terms of consistency and pricing."

The rotisserie chicken is moist and flavorful, and the sides like cilantro rice are a perfect complement. The staff is friendly and attentive, making the dining experience enjoyable.

The only minor downside is that the chicken can occasionally be a bit dry, but overall, it's a great place to visit for a satisfying meal."

The staff was often inattentive, and the wait times were excessively long, especially during peak hours. The store also appeared disorganized, with out-of-stock items and messy counters.

The staff seemed overwhelmed and the place could use a good cleaning, which is a bit off-putting when you're looking for a quick, convenient snack. Still, I appreciate the 24/7 availability and the free Wi-Fi, but there's definitely room for improvement in terms of service and cleanliness."

The Turkish cuisine, particularly the lamb and chicken gyros, was quite flavorful and satisfying, which aligns with my appreciation for high-quality and well-executed dishes. However, the service was somewhat inconsistent; while some staff were friendly, others seemed less attentive. The atmosphere was cozy and welcoming, but the portions were on the smaller side for the price, which I found a bit disappointing. Overall, it's a decent spot, but not quite the standout experience I was hoping for."

The food quality is generally high, and the pizza is a standout, often praised by other reviewers. However, the service can be inconsistent, with some visits being more positive than others. While the atmosphere is clean and welcoming, it might not be as romantic or upscale as one might hope for a special occasion. The prices are a bit on the higher side, and the portions could be more generous. Overall, it's a decent choice for Italian food, but it doesn't quite hit all the marks that I value most in a dining experience."

The staff was super friendly, and the place had a cozy, trendy vibe that made me want to stay longer. Definitely worth the slightly higher price tag for the quality and portion sizes."
