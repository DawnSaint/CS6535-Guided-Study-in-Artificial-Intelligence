While the cupcakes and desserts were indeed delicious and beautifully presented, the service was unreliable, which is a big deal for me. The owner, Chelle, was responsive at first but then became uncommunicative, especially when issues arose. This inconsistency and lack of professionalism, particularly for important events, is a significant drawback. I appreciate the free delivery and the reasonable prices, but the reliability issues and unprofessional behavior make it hard to recommend this bakery without reservation."

The outdoor seating area is a nice touch, making it a great spot for a casual dinner. However, the service was a bit hit or miss. While some servers were attentive and friendly, others were slow and understaffed, which affected the overall dining experience. The food was fresh and the portions were reasonable, but the prices were a bit steep for what was offered. Overall, it's a decent place to try, but there's room for improvement in service and value."

The food was underwhelming, with a dry veggie burger and a lackluster goat cheese salad, and the service was painfully slow and inattentive. The place could use a good cleaning too; it felt more like a last resort than a relaxing stop before a flight. Not a great spot for a pre-flight meal."

Jim initially quoted a low price but kept increasing it as the work progressed, leading to significant financial stress. The quality of work was also poor, resulting in further leaks and water damage. His unprofessional behavior, including rude interactions and lack of transparency, made the entire process a nightmare. I cannot recommend this business to anyone."
