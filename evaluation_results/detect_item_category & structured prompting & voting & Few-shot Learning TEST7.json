While the cupcakes and desserts were indeed delicious and beautifully presented, the service was unreliable, which is a big deal for me. The owner, Chelle, was responsive at first but then became uncommunicative, especially when issues arose. This inconsistency and lack of professionalism, particularly for important events, is a significant drawback. I appreciate the free delivery and the reasonable prices, but the reliability issues and unprofessional behavior make it hard to recommend this bakery without reservation."

The outdoor seating area is a nice touch, making it a great spot for a casual dinner. However, the service was a bit hit or miss. While some servers were attentive and friendly, others were slow and understaffed, which affected the overall dining experience. The food was fresh and the portions were reasonable, but the prices were a bit steep for what was offered. Overall, it's a decent place to try, but there's room for improvement in service and value."

The variety of delicious frozen yogurt flavors, especially the tart and pomegranate raspberry sorbet, is impressive, and the extensive topping selection, including fresh fruits and unique options like butterscotch chips, is a real plus. However, the service can be hit or miss, with some staff being friendly and helpful while others are less attentive. The pricing model, which charges by weight, can be steep, especially if you overfill your cup. Despite these drawbacks, the overall experience is still enjoyable, but there's room for improvement in consistency and value."

The staff, particularly Dr. Mertzlufft, are incredibly knowledgeable, friendly, and attentive, making the entire experience delightful. The office is clean and well-maintained, and they offer convenient hours, including Saturdays, which is a huge plus. The only potential downside could be the parking lot, but it's managed well and didn't detract from my positive visit. Highly recommend!"
